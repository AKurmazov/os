As we increase the size, hit/miss ratio also increases.
(For the given input data)

We would achieve the maximum hit/miss ratio in case if the import was consisted of
the same number repeated over and over again. For example, if the input was
> k k k k ... k — repeated n times, then there would be exactly 1 miss (first one),
and (n - 1) misses, thus the hit/miss ratio would be (n - 1)

On the other hand, if the import numbers never repeated themselves, then the
hit/miss ratio would be the minimum — zero. For example, in this case:
> 1 2 3 4 ... n — no hits, and n misses. Hit/miss ratio: 0.0
