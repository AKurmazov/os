Since stdout is line buffered, in the second code snippet the buffer
is going to be flushed before the fork instruction is called, thus
we see only one 'Hello' being printed. On the other hand, in the first
snippet 'Hello' is printed twice due to the reason that a line is not
switched (and the buffer is not flushed) before forking.
